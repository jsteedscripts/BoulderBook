# BoulderBook {WIP}
BoulderBook is a web app built using the MERN stack. The intention is for climbers to be able to use this to log boulder problems they send. I'm creating this with gym bouldering in mind. Users can log the problem's grade, number of attempts, wall angle, whether the send was a flash or not, the types of holds, and moves used to complete the problem. I've implemented user authentication and the storage/retrieval of problems. Next, I intend to make a dashboard page that shows the user's progress with helpful visualizations.

I may expand this in the following ways:
* Use machine learning to predict a climber's future problem sends
* Allow users to log top rope and sport routes as well
* Allow users to log supplemental hangboarding, lifting, core, etc. workouts
* Add user bios
* Add a blogging/social media aspect
