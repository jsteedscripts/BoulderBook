# BoulderBook {WIP}
BoulderBook is a web app built using the MERN stack. The intention is for climbers to be able to use this to log boulder problems they send. I'm creating this with gym bouldering in mind. Users can log the problem's grade, number of attempts, wall angle, whether the send was a flash or not, the types of holds, moves used to complete the problem, and the name of the gym. User authentication has also been implemented.
